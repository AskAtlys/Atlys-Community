# Welcome to the Atlys Community Dashboard

### Overview
This is a public repository to store data contributed anonymously by citizens in an effort to crowdsource information about communities' health status and reported symptoms. Data is contributed via the [Atlys mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.askatlys) and sent to a Mongo database before being exported to an AWS S3 bucket. New dataset files are manually exported from S3 and uploaded to this repository daily. This repository is maintained by [Atlys Networks](https://www.atlys.ca) but all data files are publicly open for researchers, analysts, and organizations to download and use.

### Acknowledgements
We want to thank all individuals who have been willing and able to anonymously contribute data about their symptoms and health status.
